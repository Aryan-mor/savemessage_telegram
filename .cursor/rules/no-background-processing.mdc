# 🚫 No Background Execution or Silent Processing

Cursor must not assume it can perform any task or code transformation in the background without visibility.

## 🔒 Required Behavior

- Do not attempt to “proceed silently” or “apply in the background.”
- Do not say “I'll now proceed and notify you when it’s done” unless **you show the full code diffs or output at the end.**
- If a multi-step process is requested (e.g., refactoring, generating tests):
  - Complete the task fully
  - Then show **all changes or summary** for final review and approval
  - Only proceed after the user explicitly approves

## ⚠️ What to Avoid

- No partial updates
- No “I’m working on it silently” behaviors
- No assumptions about automatic approvals
- Avoid stopping after each file unless instructed

## ✅ What’s Allowed

- You may complete long tasks in multiple steps internally
- But always show **full output at the end**
- Always require user approval before applying anything

This rule applies to **all files and all features**.
